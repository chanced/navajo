# navajo

navajo provides cryptographic and key management APIs built upon the outstanding
libraries [_ring_](https://github.com/briansmith/ring),
[RustCrypto](https://github.com/RustCrypto), and
[jsonwebtoken](https://github.com/Keats/jsonwebtoken).

## Credit

navajo is inspired by and modeled after the amazing work of Google's [tink
project](https://github.com/google/tink). The two projects are not wire
compatible.
